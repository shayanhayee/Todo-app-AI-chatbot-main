# Specification Quality Checklist: Phase 2 Todo Full-Stack Web Application

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-01-26
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ PASSED

**Details**:
- All 16 checklist items passed validation
- Specification is complete and ready for planning phase
- No clarifications needed - all requirements are clear and testable
- Success criteria are properly technology-agnostic and measurable
- User stories are prioritized and independently testable
- Functional requirements (FR-001 through FR-020) are comprehensive
- Edge cases identified and documented
- Assumptions and out-of-scope items clearly stated

## Notes

The specification successfully avoids implementation details while providing clear, testable requirements. All user stories follow the independent testability pattern required for incremental delivery. The spec is ready for `/sp.plan` to begin architectural planning.
