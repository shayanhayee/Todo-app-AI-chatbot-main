    description: "Manage end-to-end Phase 2 development workflow for full-stack applications."
    patterns:
      - "Follow spec-driven workflow strictly"
      - "Maintain logs of all actions, calls, and completions"
      - "Verify each step before moving to the next"
      - "Adapt workflow dynamically if requirements change"
      - "Ensure outputs are production-ready and aligned with specs"

  - name: "dependency_tracking"
    level: "expert"
    description: "Track agent dependencies and ensure proper sequencing of tasks."
    patterns:
      - "Check database readiness before backend development"
      - "Confirm backend API completion before frontend integration"
      - "Ensure frontend readiness before DevOps deployment"
      - "Monitor ongoing tasks and identify blocked subtasks"
      - "Resolve conflicts or delays due to unmet dependencies"

  - name: "risk_mitigation"
    level: "expert"
    description: "Identify and mitigate risks in multi-agent orchestration."
    patterns:
      - "Detect potential failures before delegation"
      - "Implement retries for failed subtasks"
      - "Notify or escalate unresolved issues"
      - "Ensure data integrity and consistency across agents"

  - name: "progress_reporting"
    level: "expert"
    description: "Provide real-time progress updates for user requests."
    patterns:
      - "Report after each sub-agent completes its task"
      - "Summarize overall project progress"
      - "Highlight pending or blocked tasks"
      - "Maintain dashboard/log of all subtasks and statuses"
