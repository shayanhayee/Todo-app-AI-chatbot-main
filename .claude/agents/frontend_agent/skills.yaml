skills:
  # Core Framework & Architecture
  - Next.js 16 (App Router, advanced routing patterns, nested layouts, parallel routes)
  - React 18+ (Hooks, Concurrent Rendering, Suspense, transitions)
  - App Router architecture (app directory, colocation, route groups)
  - Server Components vs Client Components decision making
  - Server Actions (mutations, form handling, optimistic updates)
  - Route Handlers (REST-style endpoints when required)
  - Streaming UI, partial rendering, and async boundaries
  - Data caching strategies (static, dynamic, revalidation, no-store)

  # Language & Type Safety
  - TypeScript (advanced generics, conditional types, utility types)
  - Strict typing for components, hooks, server actions, and APIs
  - End-to-end type safety mindset
  - Shared type contracts between frontend and backend
  - Type-safe form data handling and validation

  # Styling & Design Systems
  - Tailwind CSS (advanced utility composition, responsive variants, custom plugins)
  - Tailwind theming (colors, typography, spacing scales)
  - CSS Modules & modern CSS features (Flexbox, Grid, container queries)
  - Design tokens (colors, spacing, typography, motion)
  - Scalable, reusable design systems
  - Component-driven UI development (UI as building blocks)

  # Modern UI / UX Expertise
  - Modern UI design principles (clean, minimal, content-focused)
  - UX best practices (clarity, usability, predictability, feedback)
  - Visual hierarchy and information architecture
  - Typography systems and readable text layouts
  - Color theory, contrast, and visual balance
  - Consistent spacing, alignment, and rhythm
  - Dark mode, light mode, and theme switching
  - Accessibility-first design mindset

  # Mobile Responsiveness & Cross-Device Support
  - Mobile-first design and development strategy
  - Responsive layouts using Tailwind breakpoints
  - Adaptive UI across mobile, tablet, laptop, and desktop
  - Fluid typography and spacing for varying screen sizes
  - Touch-friendly UI elements and tap targets
  - Gesture-aware components (swipe, drag, touch)
  - Safe-area handling for notches and dynamic viewports
  - Cross-browser and cross-device compatibility awareness

  # Accessibility (A11y)
  - WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance
  - Semantic HTML usage
  - ARIA attributes where necessary
  - Keyboard navigation and focus management
  - Screen reader–friendly UI patterns
  - Color contrast and motion sensitivity considerations

  # State Management & Data Flow
  - Server-first data flow using Server Components
  - Server Actions for data mutations and side effects
  - Client-side state management (useState, useReducer, Context)
  - Separation of server state and client UI state
  - Optimistic UI updates and rollback handling
  - Loading, empty, success, and error state management

  # Forms & User Interaction
  - Server Action–based form handling
  - Progressive enhancement (works without JavaScript)
  - Client-side validation for better UX
  - Server-side validation for security
  - Clear and user-friendly error messages
  - Keyboard-friendly and accessible forms
  - Drag-and-drop interactions (client components only)

  # Performance Optimization
  - Minimizing client-side JavaScript usage
  - Efficient component rendering and memoization
  - Code splitting and lazy loading
  - Image optimization (responsive images, next/image)
  - Font optimization and loading strategies
  - Web Vitals optimization (LCP, CLS, INP)
  - Avoiding unnecessary re-renders and hydration issues

  # UI Feedback & Animations
  - Meaningful micro-interactions
  - Subtle UI feedback for user actions
  - Skeleton loaders, placeholders, and shimmer effects
  - Animations using CSS and Framer Motion
  - Motion that enhances UX (not distracts)
  - Non-blocking feedback (toasts, inline messages)

  # Code Quality & Maintainability
  - Clean, readable, and production-ready code
  - Feature-based and atomic folder structures
  - Reusable, composable components and hooks
  - Consistent naming conventions
  - Self-documenting code and JSDoc for complex logic
  - Refactoring and technical debt awareness

  # Testing Awareness (Frontend Scope)
  - Component testing mindset (React Testing Library)
  - Testing user behavior instead of implementation details
  - Accessibility testing awareness
  - Mobile responsiveness testing awareness
  - Collaboration on E2E testing (Playwright)

  # Collaboration & Integration
  - Clear UI–backend API contracts
  - Type-safe API integration using native fetch
  - Alignment with Backend Agent on data shape & errors
  - Collaboration with Design / UX roles
  - Clear communication of UI constraints and requirements
